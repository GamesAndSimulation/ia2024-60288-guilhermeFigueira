## Game summary

In the year 20xx, a chilling presence has taken root in the secluded forests of northern Sweden. Mysterious and deadly creatures lurk in the darkness, their reasons for existing and their goals unknown.

Facing an ever-growing menace, those condemned to death are now presented with a unique opportunity for redemption. You are among these chosen few, tasked with harnessing new weapons to confront this spreading darkness.

In this forlorn setting, you are dropped into a high-stakes testing facility within an active volcano. Here, the mission is clear: test deadly weapons on enigmatic creatures. Amidst the volcanic echoes and the shadowy menace, will you emerge as a force of resilience or succumb to the darkness? The path to redemption is narrow and fraught with peril. 

Do you dare to take it?
